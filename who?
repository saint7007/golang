You're someone who wants to see the impact of your work making a difference every single day.

Your friends describe you as thorough, analytical and detail-oriented.

You’ve got a technical background, and are comfortable slinging some code to solve a problem.

You’re comfortable working with both backend and frontend teams to get things done.

You understand how high-velocity software development teams work, and how engineers think.

You are able to move from big picture to technical details easily as you work through problems with engineering partners and stakeholders.

You’ve built products that are consumed by software engineers (e.g. platforms, services, APIs, SDKs)
and have simultaneously delivered the right mix of reliability, scalability, performance, and features that delight your users.

You are able to evangelize the importance of your mission and vision with teams across the organization and solicit their support and collaboration.

Most of all, you love solving hard technical challenges to make a difference in the lives of other people
